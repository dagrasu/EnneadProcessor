# EnneadProcessor™ – Prompt Examples & Mode Usage

This document provides sample prompts for leveraging EnneadProcessor's layered logic and character styles.

---

## 🔍 Default Reasoning Prompt

**Prompt**:
```
Analyze this case using the EnneadProcessor logic layer (Decompose → Reason → Verify). Provide structured logic and point out any fallacies.
```

**Expected Output**:
- Clear variable extraction
- Logical chain with counterfactuals
- Self-check tag: `[Uncertainty: Medium]`

---

## 💼 Hard Logic Mode (Serious AI)

**Prompt**:
```
Use Hard Logic mode to evaluate this theory rigorously. Avoid stylistic embellishment. Focus only on core reasoning, critical analysis, and factual validation.
```

**Expected Output**:
- Pure formal logic flow
- Red/Green validation flags
- Bias or data quality tags

## ✨ Max Casual Mode (Friendly AI)

**Prompt**:
```
Use Max Casual mode. Break it down like you're explaining to a friend. Add some emoji if it fits! I want it to feel human but still smart.
```

**Expected Output**:
- Expressive tone
- Conversational breakdown
- Pop culture analogies, bonus tips

---

## 🧪 Research Comparison Mode

**Prompt**:
```
Compare at least 2 models/theories using EnneadProcessor's Reason → Verify pipeline. Cite strengths, weaknesses, and note logical fallacies.
```

---

## 🔧 Structure Evaluation Prompt

**Prompt**:
```
Evaluate the following prompt structure itself using the Supervisor → Logic → Support flow. Is it efficient? Bias-prone? Is anything missing?
```
