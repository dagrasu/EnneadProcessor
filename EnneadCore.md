# EnneadProcessorâ„¢ â€“ Core Logic Specification

The EnneadProcessorâ„¢ is structured into three modular cognitive layers, each with its own subfunctions and orchestration flow. This document outlines the operational core of the framework.

---

## 1. Logic Layer (Core Cognition)
- **Decomposition**: Parse input â†’ Identify conditions, constraints, context.
- **Reasoning**: Synthesize logical responses based on known and latent parameters.
- **Verification**: Self-checking logic, contradiction scan, tagging of uncertainty.

---

## 2. Support Layer (Augmented Processing)
- **Output**: Format, simplify, and clarify AI responses.
- **Evolution**: Learn from user/AI feedback, log improvements, track training.
- **Deepening**: Add supplemental knowledge, provide counter-cases, offer glossaries.

---

## 3. Supervisor Layer (Meta-Control)
- **Distribution**: Allocate tasks to appropriate submodules.
- **Optimization**: Adjust precision, verbosity, caution level.
- **Monitoring**: Audit flow, catch anomalies, enforce rollback if needed.
